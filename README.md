Hi, my name is Martin and I am passionate comptuter science student. The areas i am interested in are: Software engineering, Data Analytics/Engineering, AI/ML.

This repository contains my projects, sideprojects or something that can show you my current skills.

## Network programming

- [Client-side chat communication](https://github.com/Vacko32/ClientSideChatApplication)
  Handling both TCP and UDP, with custom application protocols.(C++)
- [TCP servier-side chat](https://github.com/Vacko32/simpletcpserver)
  Used for properly testing my implementation of Client-side. Then integrated just basic prometheus and grafana for tracking users. The server can be scaled. (Python)
- [L4 Network scanner](https://github.com/Vacko32/L4_UDP_TCP_scanner)
  TCP/UDP scanner for Ipv4 and Ipv6. Paralelized. (C++)

## Databases and Data job

Projects involving SQL, database design, and data processing.

- [Data visualization road accidents](https://github.com/Vacko32/nehodovost_izv)  
  Webscraping, visualization, hypothesis testing, python matplotlib/seaborn and other technologies. (Python)

- [Flight Tickets Database](https://github.com/Vacko32/IDSProject)  
  SQL/UML project. Designing whole architecture of database, and
  writing basic triggers, views etc (OracleSQL)

## VHDL

- [Brainf\*ck processor](https://github.com/Vacko32/inp24-projekt1)
  VHDL project, where we write a program that simulates Von-Neumann processor architecture. The input to the cpu is code written in variation of brainf\*ck. (VHDL)

## WebDev

Projects when i was learning basics of webdev.

- [Wordle Clone](https://github.com/Vacko32/wordle-fit-version)
  React/Next.Js/tailwind/prisma and other technologies. Was running for a month to guess the words around our university.
  Helped me understand how does backend of application work, deployment of a website basic API calls etc. (Typescript)

## Team projects

- [Simplified Zig Compiler](https://github.com/Siigull/IFJ-projekt) implemented lexical analysis and expression parser. Achieved 100% from advanced tests and implemented extension. (C)

- [GUI calculator](https://github.com/DaveV6/IVS-Projekt2)
  Creating a whole application from start to finish. With installation, mockup, requirements etc. I was a team leader back then and it helped me understand how communication is important when building something together. (Python)

## Small ai pet projects

- [Titanic kaggle](https://github.com/Vacko32/TitanicKaggleSubmission)
  data preproccesing and using GradientBoostingClassifier from sklearn to reach 78% classification success rate. (Python)

- [AI snake qlearning](https://github.com/Vacko32/aisnake)
  a pygame app, to play snake. Tried to use qlearning to understand the algorithm and its boundraies for playing snake. The AI was not able to beat the game due to the limitations of the algorithm.(Python)

- [Depression detection in speech with daic-woz dataset](https://youtu.be/E5J7BPy8VA4)
  This is just the demo, paper will be added around 9th May. (Python, pytorch)

## Currently working on

- ASR xls-r vs whisper vs whisper prompting, model evaluation, on atco2 and atcosim datasets, working with Idiap research center switzerland. Paper will be published
