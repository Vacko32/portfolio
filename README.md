  Webscraping, visualization, hypothesis testing, python matplotlib/seaborn and other technologies.

- [Flight Database](https://github.com/Vacko32/IDSProject)  
  SQL/UML project. Designing whole architecture of database, and
  writing basic triggers, views etc

## VHDL

- [Brainf\*ck processor](https://github.com/Vacko32/inp24-projekt1)
  VHDL project, where we write a program that simulates Von-Neumann processor architecture. The input to the cpu is code written in variation of brainf\*ck.

## C++

- [L4 Network scanner](https://git.fit.vutbr.cz/xvaculm00/ipk2025)
  TCP/UDP scanner for Ipv4 and Ipv6. Paralelized.

## WebDev

Projects when i was learning basics of webdev.

- [Wordle Clone](https://github.com/Vacko32/wordle-fit-version)
  React/Next.Js/tailwind/prisma and other technologies. Was running for a month to guess the words around our university

## Projects i contributed to or pet projects

- [Simplified Zig Compiler](https://github.com/Vacko32/wordle-fit-version) implemented lexical analysis and expression parser

- [Titanic kaggle](https://github.com/Vacko32/TitanicKaggleSubmission)
  data preproccesing and using GradientBoostingClassifier from sklearn to reach 78% classification success rate.

- [AI snake qlearning](https://github.com/Vacko32/aisnake)
  a pygame app, to play snake. Tried to use qlearning to understand the algorithm and its boundraies for playing snake. The AI was not able to beat the game due to the limitations of the algorithm.

## Currently working on

- ASR whisper model evaluation
- Depression detection in speech with daic-woz dataset
- Client-Server chat application, C++
